# File Encryption/Decryption System in Python

This Python-based file encryption and decryption system allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt files using a strong encryption algorithm. The system provides an easy-to-use interface for protecting sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users can access it.

## Features

- **Encrypt Files:** Encrypt any file with a secure key to protect sensitive information.
- **Decrypt Files:** Decrypt files back to their original state using the correct encryption key.
- **AES Encryption:** The system uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key for encryption, ensuring high-level security.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the file encryption/decryption system, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
